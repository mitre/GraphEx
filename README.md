# About Graphex

Graphex is a visual programming (language) application that allows you to build and execute 'graphs'. Each graph contains 'nodes' that perform different operations in the order created by the user. A fully connected graph is equivalent to a python script (or program).

You do not need any programming knowledge to use Graphex. It was designed to allow anyone to write computer programs (visually) without writing lines of code.
